# Introduction of modules

Beego is evolving to LEGO model which means becoming modular system.  Each modular is one of the building blocks and you can build the application you want with these blocks. Since beego 1.0 there are these modules below:

- [Session Module](./session.md)
- [Cache Module](./cache.md)
- [Logs Module](./logs.md)
- [Httplib Module](./httplib.md)
- [Context Module](./context.md)
- [Toolbox Module](./toolbox.md)
- [Config Module](./config.md)
