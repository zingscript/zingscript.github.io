# Introduction to bee tool

Bee tool is a project for help develope beego rapidly. With bee tool we can crate, auto compile and reload, develop, test, and deploy beego applications easily.

## Installing bee tool

You can install bee tool through following command:

	go get github.com/beego/bee
	
`bee` is installed into `GOPATH/bin` by default. You need to add `GOPATH/bin` to your PATH, otherwise the `bee` command won't work.

## Bee tool commands

Type `bee` in command line. We can see following messages:

```
Bee is a tool for managing beego framework.

Usage:

	bee command [arguments]

The commands are:

    new         create an application base on beego framework
    run         run the app which can hot compile
    pack        compress an beego project
    api         create an api application base on beego framework
    router      auto-generate routers for the app controllers
    test        test the app
    bale        packs non-Go files to Go source files	
```	

### Command new

`new` can create a new web project. You can create a new beego project by typing `bee new <project name>` under `$GOPATH`. It will generate all the project folders and files:

```
bee new myproject
[INFO] Creating application...
/gopath/src/myproject/
/gopath/src/myproject/conf/
/gopath/src/myproject/controllers/
/gopath/src/myproject/models/
/gopath/src/myproject/static/
/gopath/src/myproject/static/js/
/gopath/src/myproject/static/css/
/gopath/src/myproject/static/img/
/gopath/src/myproject/views/
/gopath/src/myproject/conf/app.conf
/gopath/src/myproject/controllers/default.go
/gopath/src/myproject/views/index.tpl
/gopath/src/myproject/main.go
13-11-25 09:50:39 [SUCC] New application successfully created!
```

```
myproject
├── conf
│   └── app.conf
├── controllers
│   └── default.go
├── main.go
├── models
├── static
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   └── js
└── views
    └── index.tpl

8 directories, 4 files
```

### Commnad run

When we develop Go project, we often have problem that we need to compile the project and run it manually. `bee run` command will supervise the file system of beego project by inotify so that we can see the result directly after the modifications for project.

```
bee run
13-11-25 09:53:04 [INFO] Uses 'myproject' as 'appname'
13-11-25 09:53:04 [INFO] Initializing watcher...
13-11-25 09:53:04 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/myproject/controllers)
13-11-25 09:53:04 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/myproject/models)
13-11-25 09:53:04 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/myproject)
13-11-25 09:53:04 [INFO] Start building...
13-11-25 09:53:16 [SUCC] Build was successful
13-11-25 09:53:16 [INFO] Restarting myproject ...
13-11-25 09:53:16 [INFO] ./myproject is running...
```
Open browser and visit `http://localhost:8080/`, you should see some changes:

After modifing the `default.go` file in `controllers` folder, we can see
these output in command line:

```
13-11-25 10:11:20 [EVEN] "/gopath/src/myproject/controllers/default.go": DELETE|MODIFY
13-11-25 10:11:20 [INFO] Start building...
13-11-25 10:11:20 [SKIP] "/gopath/src/myproject/controllers/default.go": CREATE
13-11-25 10:11:23 [SKIP] "/gopath/src/myproject/controllers/default.go": MODIFY
13-11-25 10:11:23 [SUCC] Build was successful
13-11-25 10:11:23 [INFO] Restarting myproject ...
13-11-25 10:11:23 [INFO] ./myproject is running...
```

Refresh browser we can see the result of the modifications are already
there.

### Commnad api

The `new` command is used for crating new web applications. But there are many user use  beego for developing API applications. We can use `api` command to create API applications. Here is the result of running `bee api project_name`:

```
bee api apiproject
create app folder: /gopath/src/apiproject
create conf: /gopath/src/apiproject/conf
create controllers: /gopath/src/apiproject/controllers
create models: /gopath/src/apiproject/models
create tests: /gopath/src/apiproject/tests
create conf app.conf: /gopath/src/apiproject/conf/app.conf
create controllers default.go: /gopath/src/apiproject/controllers/default.go
create tests default.go: /gopath/src/apiproject/tests/default_test.go
create models object.go: /gopath/src/apiproject/models/object.go
create main.go: /gopath/src/apiproject/main.go
```

Here is the project structure of this API application:

```
apiproject
├── conf
│   └── app.conf
├── controllers
│   └── default.go
├── main.go
├── models
│   └── object.go
└── tests
    └── default_test.go
```

Compare to Web application, the API application doesn't have static and
views folder but a test module for unit testing.

### Commnad test

This is a wrapper for `go test`. It can run the test cases in test foler
of beego project.

```
bee test apiproject
13-11-25 10:46:57 [INFO] Initializing watcher...
13-11-25 10:46:57 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/apiproject/controllers)
13-11-25 10:46:57 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/apiproject/models)
13-11-25 10:46:57 [TRAC] Directory(/gopath/src/apiproject)
13-11-25 10:46:57 [INFO] Start building...
13-11-25 10:46:58 [SUCC] Build was successful
13-11-25 10:46:58 [INFO] Restarting apiproject ...
13-11-25 10:46:58 [INFO] ./apiproject is running...
13-11-25 10:46:58 [INFO] Start testing...
13-11-25 10:46:59 [TRAC] ============== Test Begin ===================
PASS
ok  	apiproject/tests	0.100s
13-11-25 10:47:00 [TRAC] ============== Test End ===================
13-11-25 10:47:00 [SUCC] Test finish
```

### Commnad pack

`pack` command is used to compress the project into a single file. Then we can deploy the project by uploading and extracting the zip file to the server.

```
bee pack
app path: /gopath/src/apiproject
GOOS darwin GOARCH amd64
build apiproject
build success
exclude prefix:
exclude suffix: .go:.DS_Store:.tmp
file write to `/gopath/src/apiproject/apiproject.tar.gz`
```

We can see compressed file in the project folder:

```
rwxr-xr-x  1 astaxie  staff  8995376 11 25 22:46 apiproject
-rw-r--r--  1 astaxie  staff  2240288 11 25 22:58 apiproject.tar.gz
drwxr-xr-x  3 astaxie  staff      102 11 25 22:31 conf
drwxr-xr-x  3 astaxie  staff      102 11 25 22:31 controllers
-rw-r--r--  1 astaxie  staff      509 11 25 22:31 main.go
drwxr-xr-x  3 astaxie  staff      102 11 25 22:31 models
drwxr-xr-x  3 astaxie  staff      102 11 25 22:31 tests
```

### Commnad router

This command doesn't worked yet. In the future it will generate the routers by analyse the function in controllers.

### Commnad bale

This commnad is currently only available to developer team. It's mainly used for  compressing all the static files in to a single binary file. So we don't need to carry  static files including js, css, images and views when publish the project. Those files will be self-extracting with non-overwrite when program starts.

## Bee tool configuration

You may notice that there is a file named `bee.json` in bee tool source code folder, this file is the configuration file of beego. The full features haven't been done yet, but there are some options you'd like to use for now:

- `"version": 0`: version of file, for checking incompatible format version.
- `"go_install": false`: if you use full import path like `github.com/user/repo/subpkg`, then you can enable this opetion to run `go install` and speed up you build processes.
- `"watch_ext": []`: add other file extensions to watch(only watch `.go` files by default).
- `"dir_structure":{}`: if your folders' name are not same as MVC classic name, you can use this option use change them.
- `"cmd_args": []`: add command arguments for every start.
- `"envs": []`: setting environment variables for every start.
